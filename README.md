# Data-Scraping


This project is a data scraping solution that helps to generate n-case numbers based on a given case number and scrap data from USCIS website using Python and Scrapy framework. The raw data scraped from the website is transformed into useful attributes such as form-type, case receipt number, case status, and related date. The transformed data is then stored in a CSV format and can be used to create dashboards.

## Features


**Case Number Generation**: The project allows you to generate n-case numbers based on a given case number.

**Web Scraping**: The project uses the Scrapy framework to scrape data from a website. The framework provides an easy-to-use API that makes it simple to extract data from websites.

**Data Transformation**: The raw data scraped from the website is transformed into useful attributes such as form type, case number, case status, and date. This helps to clean and organize the data for further analysis.

**Data Storage**: The transformed data is stored in a CSV format, which is a common format for data storage and transfer. This makes it easy to access and use the data for further analysis.

**Dashboard Creation**: The data can be used to create dashboards that provide visual representations of the data. This makes it easy to understand and interpret the data.
